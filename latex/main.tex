%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
    For decades, the ability to accurately project price fluctuations of goods
    and services has been sought after. It would be both beneficial to
    stakeholders and as a basis of the projection of future economic outcomes.
    It’s critical that we can be prepared for unexpected events that can
    drastically alter the markets. Using historical reports of commodity price
    during times of distress and disasters, we hope to uncover better
    forecasting and improve both preparedness and predictive results. In order
    to accomplish this task, this paper will focus on analyzing historical
    documents of the price of commodities fluctuation as time passes. As
    pervious research has demonstrated, there are multiple reports and results
    in aiding better forecast projections.    
\end{abstract}

%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT

\section{Introduction}

The price fluctuation of good and stocks are often difficult to predict due to
the numerous amounts of variables that play an important role of the price
function. While there exists research that reflects on those expected variables
\cite{romero}. Additionally, the research conducted which compares multiple results
comprised from other researchers and their unique test leading to their results
\cite{srivastava}.  The importance of being able to accurately predict the price of
commodities is vital to creating plans to aid those in need. The more accurate
our forecasting ability is, the better prepared we can hope to be in uncertain
times. It would allow emergency services and first responders to allocate enough
supplies in the event of unpredictable events that could cause server damage to
our infrastructure.  However, there has been minimal research on the price
fluctuation of goods and stocks due to external events, such as war, pandemics,
or environmental catastrophes. While reports have been brought up that show
certain effects of specific tragedies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic report
\cite{mead}. The rate that prices fluctuate of goods and stocks during times of
crisis and compared to other times of crisis could potentially help uncover
areas which are most impacted. Including opportunities for potential preventive
measures to attempt to thwart a severe effect.

\section{Related Work}

From what we have observed there seems to be certain trends when trying to
predict natural gas prices. The trend majority of the articles such as
“Forecasting Natural Gas Spot Prices with Machine Learning” use is by taking
the price of the gas as far as you have a data set for and then using
adaptive and regression models to predict the gas prices future. The next
theme that some articles use such as “Deep Neural Network Model for
Improving Price Prediction of Natural Gas” is that they look at the current
trend of natural gas and other similar items on something like google and if
there is a trend of natural gas possibly becoming volatile with other
forecasts also coming to this conclusion then it changes the prediction
accordingly. The least common way that I have found is one explored in the
paper “Natural Gas Price Prediction with Big Data” where the authors use
sentiment analysis on a large body of literature, most commonly the news.
This way while uncommon is surprisingly effective with it being able to tell
the sentiment within the text and according to how drastic it is it changes
the predictions.

\section{Proposed Approach}

For this project we will approach it in our own unique way. We will utilize the
Energy Information Agency's Natural Gas dataset spanning the past several
years. We will also utilize a time-series regression algorithm to analyze and
predict the price for natural gas. Using a time-series regression algorithm
should help us with utilizing and processing the data set we have chosen to its
fullest extent utilizing every bit of knowledge we have to give an accurate
prediction not only of the past but also the future. Utilizing this method our
prediction data should be superior to the traditional econometric models and
have the ability to predict future data points.
